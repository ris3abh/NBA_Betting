## This project focuses on predicting the Over/Under outcome of NBA games based on the historical performance of the teams involved. It's important to note that the objective is not to surpass the accuracy of the predictions made by betting websites.

### The Over/Under bet involves a number set by the betting site, with bettors needing to decide whether the actual outcome will exceed or fall short of this number. Typically, this model will concentrate on the most frequently encountered Over/Under bet: the total combined points scored by both teams at the conclusion of a game. For instance, should the Over/Under be set at 225, and you predict the total score will be less, you choose the under. If the final score is Team A with 110 points and Team B with 105 (adding up to 215), you win the bet since 215 is less than 225.
